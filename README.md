# mvc_lessons_by_sreenu

This project showcases some of the main features of the spring mvc framework whereby a developer configures a parent container, child container and a dispatcher servlet

Additionally, a dev may offer further mvc configurations such as message converters, resources (images, js and css files), and swagger configs

The project also covers the handling of exceptions which have been thrown in the dao layer all the way to the controller till they reach the user

The project also talks about rest apis and highlights that there only difference with @Controller is that they don't return views hence no need of configuring a view resolver

In the project, ideas about how to use rest template when making a call to an api can be found since they are key in future microservices
